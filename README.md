# 🛰️ AI-Based Satellite Image Classification for Land Cover

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **AI-based land cover classification system** using **MobileNetV2 transfer learning** to classify satellite images into three categories: **Urban, Vegetation, and Water**.  
It demonstrates the application of **deep learning, remote sensing, and space-related AI**

## 🖼️ Sample Output

After training the model for 5 epochs, the system predicts land cover classes and visualizes the results as a **class-wise image collage**.

Each row in the output represents a predicted land cover category:
- **Row 1:** Urban  
- **Row 2:** Vegetation  
- **Row 3:** Water  

Below is a sample output generated by the trained MobileNetV2 model:

The visualization clearly demonstrates the model’s ability to distinguish between different land cover types using satellite imagery.
